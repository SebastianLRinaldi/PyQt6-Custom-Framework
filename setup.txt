### NEW PROJECT ENVIRONMENT SETUP

In a new terminal;
you should see something like this
"""
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5854]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

F:\_Small\344 School Python\TrackFootageEditor>
"""
then run this command 
python -m venv .venv


you might get this notification from the (python Extension)
"We noticed a new environment has been created. Do you want to select it for the workspace folder?"
- hit yes 

- the (.venv) wont show up yet in the terminal path 
- untill we actiavate the .venv 

so either in a new or the current terminal run this command
.venv\Scripts\activate

then you will get in the terminal path
(.venv) F:

- the terminal you are in might have a [yellow triangle with a !] asking you to relaunch the terminal
- you can do that or just close the current window it will lead to the same result

- but relaunching the terminal with just show that a "New" terminal isntance will use the 
(.venv) F: path instead
- essentially confirming that we actiavate the .venv correctly
- if it doesnt load automatically on a new terminal then you might have to close and repoen the vscode window

- Now here the imports in the file will still show the "import not found" error 
    - the program should still be runnable (assuming there was a current .venv file with all the imports)
    - and the .venv is ready to load in pip installs (however after installing they will show as white but no yellow import not found error)

to reload everything so that the IDE shows the imports as installed (green)

- close the current working vscode project window
- reopen it and now imports should be loaded and everything is runnable 

when you open a new terminal or run the program you should see that the path is like this
"""
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.19045.5854]
(c) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

### To Upgrade Pip 
You might get a message like this:

"""
[notice] A new release of pip is available: 25.0.1 -> 25.1.1
[notice] To update, run: python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
"""

So after we get to the point where imports show up in the IDE 
is when we want to upgrade 

- this is how the python Extension works but show how break when upgrading so we have to manually do it
  but it works
